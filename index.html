<h1>Big population does not automatically mean lots of sports</h1>
<h2>By Korey Matthews</h2>
<h3>
Sports are an important part of life in the United States.  The five major sports leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS) in the United States have numerous fans at their games, and sell countless amounts of team merchandise. According to an article from Investopedia, which cited the Green Bay Packers’ 2018 annual report, the National Football league brought in more than $8.1 billion in national revenue in 2018. 
<br>
<br>Since sports rely on viewers and an audience to succeed, the number of sports teams that a state has usually coincides with its population. California, the state with the highest population in the United States, also has the most amount of teams from the five major sports, of any state in the country, with 19. Second is Florida, the third most populous state, with 11 teams. 
<br>
<br>However, there are some exceptions. Virginia is the most populous state without a major sports team from one of the top five leagues. On the other side, Colorado has 5 of the major teams, tied for 8th among states, but is the 21st most populous state. 
<br> 
<br>Currently, Major League soccer is in the process of expanding, and will add 4 new teams in the United States by 2022.
<br>
<br>It will be interesting to see how other leagues look to expand in the future. NBA commissioner Adam Silver was quoted in a Yahoo Sports article saying that the league is not looking to expand just yet. “My answer is, you know, and it’s the same as it’s been for other U.S. cities that have expressed interest, and that is that we are just not in expansion mode at the time,” Silver said.
<br>
<br>Below are two charts, with 6 states highlighted whose ratios of sports teams to populations are outliers.
